17. **Longest Increasing Subsequence:**
    - Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a given array of integers.

18. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:**
    - Solve the classic 0/1 knapsack problem.

### Miscellaneous:
19. **LRU Cache:**
    - Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.

20. **Design a Tiny URL Service:**
    - Design a service to encode and decode tiny URLs.

21. **Design a Data Structure to Support Insert, Delete, GetRandom in Constant Time:**
    - Implement a data structure that supports constant-time insertion, deletion, and retrieval of random elements.

Remember, in addition to these questions, interviewers might ask variations or combine concepts to test problem-solving skills thoroughly. It's essential to practice a diverse range of problems and understand the underlying principles to perform well in FAANG interviews.


### Arrays and Strings:
1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:**
   - Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

2. **Minimum Window Substring:**
   - Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S that contains all the characters in T.

3. **Next Permutation:**
   - Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

### Linked Lists:
4. **Merge k Sorted Lists:**
   - Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.

5. **LRU Cache Implementation:**
   - Design and implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with O(1) operations.

### Trees and Graphs:
6. **Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree:**
   - Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.

7. **Word Ladder II:**
   - Given two words (beginWord and endWord), find all shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord.

### Sorting and Searching:
8. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays:**
   - Find the median of the two sorted arrays.

9. **Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix:**
   - Find the kth smallest element in a sorted matrix.

### Dynamic Programming:

### Miscellaneous:
12. **Implement a Trie (Prefix Tree):**
    - Implement a trie with insert, search, and delete operations.

13. **Alien Dictionary:**
    - Given a list of words, find the order of characters in an alien language.

14. **Design Twitter:**
    - Design a simplified version of Twitter.

These questions involve more complex problem-solving, require a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms, and often involve optimization. Remember, FAANG interviews may also include system design, behavioral, and coding under time constraints, so a well-rounded preparation approach is crucial.
